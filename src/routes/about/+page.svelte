            musician.

            More specifically, I am a Junior studying Computer Science at
            Carnegie Mellon University. Though technically I have only been a
            Computer Science student for 1 semester. Let me tell my story
            starting recently and going back.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            I entered CMU pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts with
            the BXA department, a combined disciplinary program between the
            College of Fine Arts and other schools. Students can choose 1
            program in the CFA, and one in an academic school. For me, I had one
            foot in the School of Music and the other in the School of Computer
            Science. I found myself wanting to study strictly Computer Science
            at CMU. So after a rather difficult few semesters completing the
            core CS classes, I was able to transfer into the School of Computer
            Science. I am now a full time SCS student!
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            Even though I have transferred from Music to CS, I have not given up
            on my music. I have been playing classical Cello for almost 16 years
            now, and I continue to play through 2 chamber groups (You can watch
            some recordings on the Music page of this website). My Cello used to
            be my defining trait and my whole identity, but now it is something
            more akin to a hobby.
