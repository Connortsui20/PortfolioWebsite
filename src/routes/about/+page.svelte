            My name is Connor Tsui, and I am a student, software engineer, and
            musician.
        </h3>
        <p class="text-3xl mb-12">
            More specifically, I am a Junior studying Computer Science at
            Carnegie Mellon University. Though technically I have only been a
            Computer Science student for 1 semester. Let me tell my story
            starting recently and going back.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            I entered CMU pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts with
            the BXA department, a combined disciplinary program between the
            College of Fine Arts and other schools. Students can choose 1
            program in the CFA, and one in an academic school. For me, I had one
            foot in the School of Music and the other in the School of Computer
            Science. I found myself wanting to study strictly Computer Science
            at CMU. So after a rather difficult few semesters completing the
            core CS classes, I was able to transfer into the School of Computer
            Science. I am now a full time SCS student!
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            Even though I have transferred from Music to CS, I have not given up
            on my music. I have been playing classical Cello for almost 16 years
            now, and I continue to play through 2 chamber groups (You can watch
            some recordings on the Music page of this website). My Cello used to
            be my defining trait and my whole identity, but now it is something
            more akin to a hobby.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            Something else about myself: I hate being stagnant. Whenever I'm on
            a break or relaxing, a little voice in my head tells me, "Why aren't
            you doing something productive? Get out there and do something good
            for once!" Maybe it's because I'm driven, maybe it's because I'm
            just slightly insane, or maybe it's because I really want to do
            something that can benefit the world and those around me. Hopefully,
            it's mostly that last one.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            I can solve problems efficiently and effectively. This ability was
            built over 4 internships during my gap year in the pandemic, then
            refined through 4 rigorous semesters of Computer Science at Carnegie
            Mellon. My expertise is Python, having taught 3 semesters of the
            introductory CS course at CMU to a majority of Freshmen who have
            never seen coding before. I have also done 2 internships as a
            front-end React developer, and worked part-time at Skeema with
            Java/TypeScript as a full-stack developer. Currently, I am working
            at TerraSim on developing procedurally generated airfields with C++.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl my-6">
            While this is my experience and background, my most important skill
            is that I can take up any challenge thrown my way and learn how to
            best solve it. I am currently looking for a Software Engineering or
            related internship for Summer 2024. Specifically, I am looking for a
            position where I can push myself, on top of producing something
            beneficial for the company I work at. To any recruiters reading
            this, I hope can consider me as a strong asset to whatever company I
            join.
